# Plant Disease Detection

**Introduction**

This project is all about detecting plant diseases using a deep learning model. It helps in identifying different types of plant diseases by analyzing images of leaves. The model is trained using TensorFlow and can recognize multiple disease types from a dataset.

**Dataset**

The dataset is downloaded automatically using kagglehub. It contains plant images with different disease labels. You donâ€™t need to worry about downloading it manually.Code : kagglehub.dataset_download("vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset")

**To run this project, install the necessary libraries:**

ensorflow, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, opencv-python, kagglehub
