# Plant Disease Detection

**Introduction**

This project is all about detecting plant diseases using a deep learning model. It helps in identifying different types of plant diseases by analyzing images of leaves which is delivered with streamlit. The model is trained using TensorFlow and can recognize multiple disease types from a dataset 'test'.

**Dataset**

The dataset is downloaded automatically using kagglehub. It contains plant images with different disease labels. You donâ€™t need to worry about downloading it manually.Code : kagglehub.dataset_download("vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset")

**To run this project, install the necessary libraries:**

Tensorflow, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, opencv-python, kagglehub, streamlit, os, cv2
